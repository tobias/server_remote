h2. Server Remote

Server Remote provides common rails application server commands over ssh.

Currently, it provides three commands:

* @remote shell@ - same as ssh'ing to the server (this is the default command, so it can be called with just @remote@)
* @remote console@ - executes a @script/console@ on the server
* @remote logtail@ - executes @tail -f log/<environment>.log@ on the server

h3. Configuration

Configuration is stored in @config/server_remote.yml@.
