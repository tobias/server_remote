h2. Server Remote

Server Remote provides common rails application server commands over ssh.

Currently, it provides three commands:

* @remote shell@ - same as ssh'ing to the server (this is the default command, so it can be called with just @remote@)
* @remote console@ - executes a @script/console@ on the server
* @remote logtail@ - executes @tail -f log/<environment>.log@ on the server

h3. Configuration

Configuration is stored in @config/server_remote.yml@. On installation, a sample file is copied to @RAILS_ENV/config/@ (along with @RAILS_ENV/script/remote@). 

The configuration file groups configurations into _profiles_. A profile defines the info needed to connect to a server, along with the path to the app and the environment it is running under. 

The default profile is _app_. This can be changed with the @default_profile:@ setting in the config file, and overridden on any call with the @-p profile@ switch.

This script uses the "simplecli":http://github.com/remi/simplecli gem from Remi Taylor. Install with @gem install remi-simplecli@.

*Note:* this plugin uses the ssh binary, which must be in your path. I have absolutely no idea if it will work on Windows.
